Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: Git allows for version control, which lets you store many different backups and different proposed
changes to make file/code management easier. When collaborating, it also makes the process of different
people contributing to the codebase easier, since it lets you smoothly merge your chances with others'.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: An example of a field where data science would be useful is medicine - data science can be used to
process and analyze medical records - for the purposes of both cleaning faulty data and analyzing it for
future utility (e.g. having data to train diagnosis models or test hypotheses for treatment).

Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: Merging and rebasing both accomplish the same final "merged" branch, 
but merging preserves the two branches that were merged together, while 
rebasing writes the changes on one branch on top of the other.

Q4: What skills do you hope to improve during this course?

Answer: I hope to both get better at processing data and to understand how
data could go wrong - e.g. have formatting issues, outliers, inaccurate
entries, corruption, etc. - and know what to look for and what to do about it.
This also has very general applications with most things that require
relatively clean data, such as ML or language processing.
